# Payload size

## Guidance

* The size of the event payload **should** have an upper limit to prevent
  it from becoming too large. A good rule of thumb is **64 KB**.
* The payload **should** avoid embedding large data items.
    * Payloads **should** use ([resource references][]) in the payload when the data is part of an API resource.
    * Payloads **should** provide direct URI links to access large data items that are not owned by an API resource.  These fields **must** be `string` fields with a `_uri` suffix, such as `audio_uri`.
